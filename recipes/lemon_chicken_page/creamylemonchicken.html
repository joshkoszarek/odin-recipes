        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper, then dredge in flour and shake off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil and melt 1 tablespoon of butter on medium heat. Swirl pan to coat with oil and butter evenly. Add the chicken cutlets to the pan.</li>
        <li>Brown the chicken (do not overcrowd and work in batches if needed) for 4-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer onto a plate, cover, and set aside.</li>

        <li>Season with salt and pepper to your taste, then put the chicken back in the sauce and let the sauce simmer and thicken for a few more minutes. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley leaves and serve warm over pasta, mashed potatoes, or rice</li>
